# Siklero

An Android Application made with Flutter catered for cyclists in need of roadside assistance.

## Getting Started

This requires using you're own Google Maps API Key or else certain features of the app won't work properly.
To change API Key, edit the **AndroidManifest.xml** file in **android/app/src/main** folder. And then replace the placeholder ID under **com.google.android.geo.API_KEY** with you're API Key
